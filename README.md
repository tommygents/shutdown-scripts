# shutdown-scripts
These are batch scripts that run on a Windows machine to shut down the machine, or kill a specific process, after a preset amount of time.

They need admin privileges to shutdown the PC or kill a process. You can either run them as an admin every time by right-clicking, or you can create shortcuts that automatically run them as admin.

They don't require any installation; they can just live on the desktop.
